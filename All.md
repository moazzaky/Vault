## Commotio Corids 

![[Pasted image 20230103113608.png]]
**Commotio cordis** is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality on the playing field. The epidemiology of commotio cordis has been well established to include young male athletes participating in sports with a solid small ball. Resuscitation is possible. Experimental models point to the importance of timing, location, velocity, and shape and hardness of the object as determinants of ventricular fibrillation. Biological characteristics such as sex, pliability of the chest wall, and genetic susceptibility also play a role. The mechanism of ventricular fibrillation in commotio cordis is likely a combination of impact-initiated heterogeneity of repolarization and a premature ventricular depolarization trigger. A reduction in the risk of commotio cordis is possible with age-appropriate safety baseballs.

**The treatment** of commotio cordis is not different from any other cardiopulmonary emergency associated with a nonperfusing cardiac rhythm. For victims of witnessed ventricular fibrillation arrest, as occurs in commotio cordis, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and rapid defibrillation can significantly increase the chances of survival.
